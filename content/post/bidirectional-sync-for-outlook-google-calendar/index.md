ðŸŽ“ðŸ’» UCL, like many large academic/public organisations, has adopted the [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/communicate-collaborate/microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise) ecosystem. As a result of the COVID pandemic and remote working this integration has been intensified and Office 365 is now the platform of choice for not only email and documents, but meetings with MS Teams.

It might be fashionable, especially in tech circles, to bemoan Microsoft but I actually think the whole package works reasonably well and is certainly an improvement over the prehistoric 'squirrelmail' webmail system that UCL had when I last studied there. I would prefer google docs, as in my personal life I'm more embedded in the google ecosystem, but MS works well enough and it means that those 'more senior' individuals familiar with Word are now able to engage in collaborative writing without learning a new tool!

ðŸš© One of the issues I don't like is the Calendar in Outlook! It's clunky and doesn't synchronise well (i.e. bidirectionally) with my personal calendars in Google Calendar.

âœ… After much googling of the issue I found the brilliant tool ["Outlook Google Calendar Sync" by phw198](https://phw198.github.io/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync/) which is a free app for *Windows only* which does exactly what it says on the tin. I particularly like the fact that it can be run as a portable app so doesn't need to be installed and clutter up your Windows installation.

Headline features:

> * Sync your Outlook and Google calendars securely, including meeting attendees, reminders, full description and more.
> * Ideal for liberating your corporate Exchange calendar, making it available on any of your devices with access to Google Calendar.
> * No install necessary, works behind web proxies and actively developed

ðŸ“‚You can download and install it from [GitHub here](https://phw198.github.io/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync/).

Sure it would be nice if there was a cross-platform version, but then you need to have Outlook running so that negates Linux anyway. As it's a portable app perhaps it could work on a Windows remote desktop but I haven't had a need to try this.

Hope this is of use to someone.
