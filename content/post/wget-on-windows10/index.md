üö© Problem: Trying to use `wget` from within Jupyter Notebooks on Windows

‚ùì `wget` is a free useful tool for downloading files (web-get) that is typically bundled with Unix-based operating systems like Linux & MacOS, but not Windows.

üí° [Eternally Bored](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) produce compiled Windows binaries of [GNU Wget (only 32-bit)](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).

üíª After downloading, move `wget.exe` into PATH (typically `C:\Windows\System32`, but can be found by entering `path` into the Windows Terminal/Command Prompt).

You can then call it via Jupyter using `!` to access terminal commands, e.g.

`!wget http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ml1/binarydigits.txt`
