Large expedition to Everest Base Camp seeking to characterise acclimatisation to environmental hypoxia in Sherpa's & Westerners to identify biomarkers of (mal-) adaptation that may inspire novel diagnostic/therapeutic targets for the cellular hypoxia seen in critical illness.

Responsibilities included:

* Forearm venous plethysmography
* Nitrate metabolism studies (exhaled, saliva, blood, 24hr urine)
* Ambulatory monitoring (SpO2, NIBP & ECG)
* Core physiological dataset (daily cardiorespiratory observations and symptom-scores)

Supervisors: Prof Mike Grocott & Prof Denny Levett
