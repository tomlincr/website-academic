🎯 Automated assessment of vascular perfusion  

🎓 Challenge owner: Prof Tony Whitehouse (University Hospital Birmingham, University of Birmingham)  
🎓 Principle Investigator: Dr Kashif Rajpoot (University of Birmingham)  

🏆 Received the 'super additive' award for 'championing collaboration & knowledge exchange'  

✍ Explored supervised (KNN, LDA, NCA) and unsupervised (PCA) machine learning techiniques and constructed a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture model to automatically extract meaningful features from videos using transfer learning (InceptionV3, imagenet weights) and fine-tuning  

💾 OpenCV, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow  

📑 Report will be published in due course at https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups#reports
