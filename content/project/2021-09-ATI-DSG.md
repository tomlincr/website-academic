🎯 Automated assessment of vascular perfusion  

🎓 Challenge owner: Prof Tony Whitehouse (University Hospital Birmingham, University of Birmingham)  
🎓 Principle Investigator: Dr Kashif Rajpoot (University of Birmingham)  

🏆 Received the **'super additive' award** for 'championing collaboration & knowledge exchange'  

✍ Explored supervised (KNN, LDA, NCA) and unsupervised (PCA) machine learning techiniques and constructed a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture model to automatically extract meaningful features from videos using transfer learning (InceptionV3, imagenet weights) and fine-tuning  

💾 OpenCV, scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow
